I want to add support for classes to jsos
I added support for prototype chains and all all properties regardless of enumerable or other property descriptor status so that constructors would get added since object.__proto__.constructor is non-enerable 
I'm going to walk to Republik and work from there this morning
Beth texted to say that Eve is sick and Kelly is going to pick her up from school

i'm on my flight now
i'm going to buy internet which is $8 so that i can work and check my email
i bought internet
i'm going to work on doing my first fine-tuning
i've been searching around to learn how to fine tune llama
my plan is to generate enough training data myself which will be natural english in the format of stream of consciousness thoughts. kind of like a journal
i have a couple pages of text that i can start with
i found one person that blogged about using Axolotl which is an open source project that tries to make fine-tuning different types of LLMs easy
yesterday i had tried to use a google collab notebook to run axolotl but didn't get it to work
i also tried googling about finetuning on a macbook with apple silicon, but didn't find anything immediately to try
i also read an anyscale blog post  https://www.anyscale.com/blog/fine-tuning-llama-2-a-comprehensive-case-study-for-tailoring-models-to-unique-applications about using ray to do finetuning with a project called Deepspeed and another called Accelerate along with other projects but i can't remember their names
one of the tutorials i just read said that they considered using open ai finetraining but then decided to use 
i need to process the free text format that i've been journaling in evernote into the structur
we landed on time but now we are sitting on the runway, so far for 15min
now we are moving to the gate
they have started to deplane
i'm going to text pete "Just getting off plane"
i just texted that to pete
but he might come too soon so i should tell him that i'm not off plane yet
i'm going to text him that we are still on the plane
i just texted "Ended up sitting on runway"
i should see where he is at so that i know how much detail i need to be texting him
I just texted pete "Where are you at now?"
I just looked at my phone and he didn't start replying yet.
he replied "I'm getting gas in San Bruno 3 mins away so just let me know where to meet you"

it is almost time to head to berkeley with andrew to meet dave and kurt and armando
we have a meeting set up for 5pm with them where we are joining their weekly wine and cheese social
we will probably be leaving in the next 5min to get to berkeley on time
i have to go pee
can i wait till we get to berkeley?
i'm going to check with my body
how long will i have to wait? 
from embarcadero to downtown usually takes 30-45 min to travel between
my bladder says it could make it but i would be uncomfortable at the end probably
i'm going to try to go now
i say to pete and andrew "I have to use the bathroom before we leave"
I say "i wonder where the bathroom is"
andrew just said "there must be one up here somewhere"
we are walking towards the bay side of the park on the path
i'm looking around for signs about a bathroom or for the bathroom itslef
i don't see any signs for the bathroom
andrew points at a pillar that has symbols and arrows on it and says "that says bathroom"

we are in andrews car, parking in berkeley now
we are outside soda hall on the street that runs alongside soda
i remember that this street is a steep hill on the part of the block that is next to soda
i think this street is calld la conte or is it la loma?
i used to live near here
i remember when i used to park my motorcycle just up there

andrew and i are sitting on the woz patio talking
we are waiting for dave or armando or kurt to show up
we are going to tell them the updates about csgv. that pete is joining and stuff
our goal is to get them excited
i'm feeling nervous
i hope it goes well
i feel confident about our messaging
i want to update andrew about the headlong work i've shifted to working on in the last couple days
i going to bring it up
i said "have you tried fine-tuning an LLM yet?"
andrew said "no"
i said "i've been trying to do in the last couple days. i started by trying to fine tune llama but then i tried OpenAI and that was pretty easy.  they've abstracted everything so it's basically just a few api calls."
andrew said "did the model perform well? could you tell you had fine tuned it?"
I wasn't able to get it to work yet so i'm going to tell him that
I said "i didn't get it working yet, need to generate more training data. the api for fine-tuning requires at least 10 example rows but i only have 3 so far"

andrew pointed past me, to something behind me
andrew said "there's dave now"
i'm going to look at dave
i twist my body turn my head to look
i see dave pulling a cart in our direction
i keep talking to andrew to try to finish my thought
andrew stands up and it seems like he wants to pause the conversation
so i pause mid-sentence and get up too
we both walk towards dave
i say "hey dave" and shake daves hand
andrew says hi and dave says hi to us

i wake up to my alarm at 6:45am
i have a routine where i go in and get eve up around 7am
i got eve up and we spent time playing and then did our morning routine
i asked beth if she wants to go to get coffee
she said yes 
i wonder if she will wants to go to mandarin or republik
we are leaving to walk to mandarin
we need to put our shoes on, go out our door, walk down the hall, ride elevator down, walk outside to mandarin
we are going down the elevator together
i turned left in the carport
beth said she assumed we are walking around because 
we are talking about Angel and the package of hours we want to propose to her
I look at my watch, it is 9:30
beth is finished eating and we've been here almost an hour so its about time to wrap up and for us to start working soon
beth is standing up, i give her a kiss and we part ways
i'm walking up to republic
i arrive at republik, i'm at republik coffee 
i'm going to order food and then work
i stand in line
i ordered a pumpkin spice latte
i feel a little guilty that i've violated my guidelines of skipping breakfast because this has sugar in it

What am I going to do this morning?
I should plan my week because it's Monday morning
What are my big picture Objectives right now in my personal to do list?
At the highest level, I've been working on two three things in two categories: (1) the business side: CSGV 2.0, (2) the research and dev side: jsos, headlong
For csgv2.0 last week I was working on the Obama thread and pitching more strategic LPs
later I have a meeting with kerner from MS for feedback on the pitch
Also Andrew 1-1 where I want to go through OKRs
And I'm meeting with JP Morgan at 11
It's 1035 now so That meeting is in 25 minutes
I'm walking to Republik now to get my morning coffee
For the Technical side, Matei gave me feedback on jsos last week 
That led me to want to add var references to support foreign key like relationships between vars 
I'm at Republik now, getting into line
ordering my coffee - hot latte
i feel a lot better after i took my 70min nap after the handoff this mornign
I'm going to sit down now
observation: Dad texted me: "Good morning, I forgot to ask you about your Dr appointment the other day. What did your cardiologist have to say?"
since this won't take super long, i'm just going to reply to dad right now instead of 
action: text him back: "He said the ticker looks good. We are gonna keep me on my low dose beta blocker since it doesn't seem to be having any significant side effects"
i should give some more details than that
